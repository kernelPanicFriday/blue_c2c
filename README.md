"# blue_c2c"

I am creating this projecct/website mainly to fill the void the is my personal github repo.

The idea is to stand up a demo cybersecurity website since that is my backgorund.
My ideas so far are;
- a landing page with populated with news and current events pulling from some API's.
- domain submission that rates a given domain with a score based on some WHOIS data and certification analysis.
- Malicious file uplad that GETs / POSTs to virustotal and shows output.
- I plan to implement a log-in feature

This will likely take longer than it really should as my two children (third on the way :] ) keep me super busy and I just started my masters program in the afternoons as well... wish me luck!
